for problems that can be benefitted from adding plots, add tikz plots between Strategy and Solution/Proof. That is, after Strategy and before the Solution. 
Don't use \legend, use \legendentry if needed. Don't put explanations in the plot, instead, put them in caption. The plot width should be less then 10cm.
