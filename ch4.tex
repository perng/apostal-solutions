Let $f$ be an increasing function defined on $[a, b]$ and let $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ be $n$ points in the interior such that $a < x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_n < b$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Show that $\sum_{k=1}^n [f(x_k+) - f(x_k-)] \leq f(b-) - f(a+)$.
\item Deduce from part (a) that the set of discontinuities of $f$ is countable.

\begin{problembox}[4.64: Strictly Increasing with Discontinuous Inverse]
Give an example of a function $f$, defined and strictly increasing on a set $S$ in $\mathbb{R}$, such that $f^{-1}$ is not continuous on $f(S)$.
\end{problembox}

\begin{problembox}[4.65: Continuity of Strictly Increasing Functions]
Let $f$ be strictly increasing on a subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}$. Assume that the image $f(S)$ has one of the following properties:

\end{problembox}

\section{Metric spaces and fixed points}

\begin{problembox}[4.66: The Metric Space of Bounded Functions]
Let $B(S)$ denote the set of all real-valued functions which are defined and bounded on a nonempty set $S$. If $f \in B(S)$, let $\|f\| = \sup_{x \in S} |f(x)|$. The number $\|f\|$ is called the "sup norm" of $f$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Prove that the formula $d(f, g) = \|f - g\|$ defines a metric $d$ on $B(S)$.
\item Prove that the metric space $(B(S), d)$ is complete. 
\end{enumerate}
\textit{Hint.} If $(f_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $B(S)$, show that $\{f_n(x)\}$ is a Cauchy sequence of real numbers for each $x$ in $S$.
\end{problembox}

\begin{problembox}[4.67: The Metric Space of Continuous Bounded Functions]
Refer to Exercise 4.66 and let $C(S)$ denote the subset of $B(S)$ consisting of all functions continuous and bounded on $S$, where now $S$ is a metric space.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Prove that $C(S)$ is a closed subset of $B(S)$.
\item Prove that the metric subspace $C(S)$ is complete.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problembox}

\begin{problembox}[4.68: Application of the Fixed-Point Theorem]
Refer to the proof of the fixed-point theorem (Theorem 4.48) for notation.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Prove that $d(p_n, p_{n+1}) \leq d(x, f(x)) \alpha^n / (1 - \alpha)$. This inequality, which is useful in numerical work, provides an estimate for the distance from $p_n$ to the fixed point $p$. An example is given in (b).
\item Take $f(x) = (x + 2/x)/2$, $S = [1, +\infty)$. Prove that $f$ is a contraction of $S$ with contraction constant $\alpha = 1/2$ and fixed point $p = \sqrt{2}$. Form the sequence $(p_n)$ starting with $x=p_0=1$ and show that $|p_n - \sqrt{2}| \le 2^{-n}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problembox}

\begin{problembox}[4.69: Necessity of Conditions for Fixed-Point Theorem]
Show by counterexamples that the fixed-point theorem for contractions need not hold if either (a) the underlying metric space is not complete, or (b) the contraction constant $\alpha \ge 1$.
\end{problembox}

\begin{problembox}[4.70: Generalized Fixed-Point Theorem]
Let $f: S \to S$ be a function from a complete metric space $(S, d)$ into itself. Assume there is a real sequence $(a_n)$ which converges to $0$ such that $d(f^n(x), f^n(y)) \le a_n d(x, y)$ for all $n \ge 1$ and all $x, y$ in $S$, where $f^n$ is the $n$th iterate of $f$, that is, 

$f^1(x) = f(x)$, $f^{n+1}(x) = f(f^n(x))$, for $n \ge 1$. 

Prove that $f$ has a unique fixed point. \textit{Hint.} Apply the fixed-point theorem to $f^m$ for a suitable $m$.
\end{problembox}

\begin{problembox}[4.71: Fixed Points for Distance-Shrinking Maps]
Let $f: S \to S$ be a function from a metric space $(S, d)$ into itself such that
\[ d(f(x), f(y)) < d(x, y) \quad \text{whenever } x \neq y. \]
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Prove that $f$ has at most one fixed point, and give an example of such an $f$ with no fixed point.
\item If $S$ is compact, prove that $f$ has exactly one fixed point. \textit{Hint.} Show that $g(x) = d(x, f(x))$ attains its minimum on $S$.
\item Give an example with $S$ compact in which $f$ is not a contraction.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problembox}

\begin{problembox}[4.72: Iterated Function Systems]
Assume that $f$ satisfies the condition in Exercise 4.71. If $x \in S$, let $p_0 = x$, $p_{n+1} = f(p_n)$, and $c_n = d(p_n, p_{n+1})$ for $n \geq 0$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Prove that $\{c_n\}$ is a decreasing sequence, and let $c = \lim c_n$.
\item Assume there is a subsequence $\{p_{k(n)}\}$ which converges to a point $q$ in $S$. Prove that
\[c = d(q, f(q)) = d(f(q), f[f(q)])].\]
Deduce that $q$ is a fixed point of $f$ and that $p_n \to q$.
\end{enumerate}
